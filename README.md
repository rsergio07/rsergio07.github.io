# Sergio Romero - Personal Website and GitHub Repositories Showcase

This repository contains the source code for my personal GitHub Pages site. The website serves as both a professional portfolio and a dynamic showcase of my public repositories. It includes a brief introduction about myself, my contact information (GitHub and LinkedIn), and a display of my repositories.

## Features

- **Personal Introduction**: A brief description of who I am and what I do, including my professional background as a Senior Site Reliability Engineer.
- **Contact Information**: Links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles are readily available for visitors to connect with me.
- **Real-Time Repository Data**: The site uses the GitHub API to fetch and display up-to-date information about my public repositories.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and adapts smoothly across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern Layout**: The site uses Google Fonts and a card-based layout for a professional and clean appearance.

## How It Works

- **Hosting**: The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://rsergio07.github.io/) and updates automatically with real-time data from my GitHub repositories.
- **Dynamic Repository Display**: The website uses JavaScript to fetch repository data from the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), displaying repositories dynamically in a card-based format.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For the layout and styling of the site.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching and displaying repository data in real-time.
