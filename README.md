# Sergio Romero - GitHub Repositories Showcase

This repository contains the source code for my personal GitHub Pages site, which showcases my public repositories. The website dynamically fetches repository information using the GitHub API and allows visitors to filter projects by categories such as AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, and more.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data**: The site fetches and displays my latest GitHub repositories using the GitHub API.
- **Category Filtering**: Visitors can filter repositories by categories like AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern Design**: Uses Google Fonts and a card-based layout for a clean and professional look.

## How It Works

- The site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://rsergio07.github.io/) and automatically updates with real-time data from my GitHub repositories.
- JavaScript is used to fetch repository data from the [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), which is then displayed dynamically in a card-based layout.
- Users can filter repositories by selecting a category from a dropdown list, which filters the projects based on topics assigned in GitHub.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For the layout and styling of the site.
- **JavaScript**: For fetching and displaying repositories in real-time.
- **GitHub API**: To retrieve repository data.
- **Google Fonts**: For modern typography.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting the site.

## Repository Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and JavaScript code to fetch repositories.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the repository.
- `style.css`: (Optional) External stylesheet if further customizations are added.
  
## How to Use

To explore the repositories showcased on this site, simply visit [my GitHub Pages site](https://rsergio07.github.io/) and use the dropdown to filter by category. The repositories displayed are always up-to-date, as they are fetched directly from GitHub.
