# Sergio Romero - Professional Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio, showcasing my expertise in **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** and **Solutions Architecture**. This project contains the source code for my GitHub Pages site, where I present my professional background, skills, and dynamic list of public GitHub repositories.

## Features

- **Social Media Integration**: Links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Credly profiles, offering access to my projects, professional network, and certifications.
- **Skills Showcase**: A detailed section listing my core competencies in cloud infrastructure, automation, and DevOps, including tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, and Docker.
- **Dynamic GitHub Repositories**: Real-time display of my public repositories using the GitHub API, allowing visitors to explore my open-source work.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For the structure and styling of the portfolio.
- **JavaScript**: Used to fetch and display repositories dynamically using the GitHub API.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting this project for easy access and updates.
- **GitHub API**: Fetches real-time data on my public repositories.

## How It Works

The portfolio is a static website hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://rsergio07.github.io). It includes an About Me section, a list of top skills, and a dynamically updated GitHub repository list. Data for repositories is fetched using the GitHub API and presented in a visually appealing card-based format.

### How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rsergio07/rsergio07.github.io.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the portfolio.
