# Sergio Romero - Professional Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio, which showcases my expertise in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and Solutions Architecture. This project hosts the source code for my GitHub Pages site, where I present my work, skills, and public GitHub repositories.

## Features

- **Social Media Integration**: Links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Credly profiles for networking and certifications.
- **Skills Showcase**: A detailed list of my top skills in cloud infrastructure, automation, and DevOps.
- **Dynamic GitHub Repositories**: Real-time display of my public repositories fetched using the GitHub API, allowing visitors to explore my work.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: The structure and styling of the portfolio.
- **JavaScript**: Used to fetch and display repositories dynamically from the GitHub API.
- **GitHub Pages**: The platform hosting this project.
- **GitHub API**: Retrieves real-time data on my public repositories.

## How It Works

The portfolio is a static website hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://rsergio07.github.io). It includes an about me section, a list of top skills, and a section for dynamically fetched GitHub repositories. The repository data is retrieved via the GitHub API and displayed in a card-based layout.

### How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rsergio07/rsergio07.github.io.git
    ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the portfolio.
